This is a project in which I had to create a replica of the famous H5AI.

## Usesage of the config.php:
- add your desired folder the at the root of the repo
- open config.php
- modify ```$config["root"] = "your_path_to_the_folder"```

## Opening the project:

- open your favorite browser and paste the route to the repo in the browser url

### Or
- if your machine have apache you can relocate the folder to he : apache2/htdocs on windows or computer/var/www/html on linux
